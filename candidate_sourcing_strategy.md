## LinkedIn Sourcing Strategy

### Optimizing LinkedIn Search Parameters

#### Basic Search Techniques

1. **Keyword Optimization**
   - Use technical skills as keywords (e.g., "Python", "React", "AWS")
   - Include certification names (e.g., "AWS Certified Solutions Architect")
   - Search for project experience (e.g., "machine learning projects")

2. **Title-Based Searches**
   - Use standardized job titles (e.g., "Software Engineer", "Data Scientist")
   - Include seniority levels (e.g., "Senior", "Lead", "Principal")
   - Search for specialized roles (e.g., "DevOps Engineer", "ML Engineer")

3. **Company Targeting**
   - Search by current or past employers (e.g., "Google", "Amazon", "Microsoft")
   - Target specific company sizes (startups vs. enterprises)
   - Focus on companies known for specific technologies

4. **Educational Background**
   - Search by universities with strong CS programs
   - Include bootcamps and technical training programs
   - Look for specific degrees or certifications

#### Advanced Search Techniques

1. **Boolean Search Strings**
   ```
   ("Software Engineer" OR "Software Developer") AND (Python OR Django) AND "Machine Learning" NOT "Junior"
   ```

2. **Experience-Based Filtering**
   - Filter by years of experience
   - Target candidates with specific project experience
   - Look for industry-specific experience

3. **Location-Based Targeting**
   - Focus on tech hubs for in-office roles
   - Search globally for remote positions
   - Target regions with specialized talent pools

4. **Passive Candidate Identification**
   - Look for candidates not marked as "Open to Work"
   - Target professionals with stable job history (2+ years at current role)
   - Identify candidates with recent activity but not job-seeking signals

### Using LinkedIn APIs for Candidate Sourcing

#### LinkedIn/search_people API Implementation

```python
import sys
sys.path.append('/opt/.manus/.sandbox-runtime')
from data_api import ApiClient

def search_tech_candidates(keywords, title=None, company=None, start=0):
    client = ApiClient()
    
    # Construct query parameters
    query_params = {
        'keywords': keywords,
        'start': str(start)
    }
    
    # Add optional parameters if provided
    if title:
        query_params['keywordTitle'] = title
    if company:
        query_params['company'] = company
    
    # Call the LinkedIn API
    results = client.call_api('LinkedIn/search_people', query=query_params)
    
    return results

# Example searches for different tech roles
software_engineers = search_tech_candidates('software engineer python javascript', title='Software Engineer')
data_scientists = search_tech_candidates('data scientist machine learning', title='Data Scientist')
devops_engineers = search_tech_candidates('devops kubernetes docker', title='DevOps Engineer')
product_managers = search_tech_candidates('product manager tech', title='Product Manager')

# Example of targeting specific companies
google_engineers = search_tech_candidates('software engineer', company='Google')
amazon_data_scientists = search_tech_candidates('data scientist', company='Amazon')

# Save results to file for further processing
import json
with open('/home/ubuntu/recruitment_agency_demo/sourcing/candidate_search_results.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump({
        'software_engineers': software_engineers,
        'data_scientists': data_scientists,
        'devops_engineers': devops_engineers,
        'product_managers': product_managers,
        'google_engineers': google_engineers,
        'amazon_data_scientists': amazon_data_scientists
    }, f, indent=2)

print("Candidate search results saved to file.")
```

#### LinkedIn/get_company_details API Implementation

```python
import sys
sys.path.append('/opt/.manus/.sandbox-runtime')
from data_api import ApiClient

def get_tech_company_details(company_name):
    client = ApiClient()
    
    # Call the LinkedIn API
    company_details = client.call_api('LinkedIn/get_company_details', query={'username': company_name})
    
    return company_details

# Example searches for major tech companies
tech_companies = ['microsoft', 'google', 'amazon', 'apple', 'meta']
company_details = {}

for company in tech_companies:
    company_details[company] = get_tech_company_details(company)

# Save results to file for further processing
import json
with open('/home/ubuntu/recruitment_agency_demo/sourcing/tech_company_details.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(company_details, f, indent=2)

print("Tech company details saved to file.")
```

#### LinkedIn/get_user_profile_by_username API Implementation

```python
import sys
sys.path.append('/opt/.manus/.sandbox-runtime')
from data_api import ApiClient

def get_candidate_profile(username):
    client = ApiClient()
    
    # Call the LinkedIn API
    profile_details = client.call_api('LinkedIn/get_user_profile_by_username', query={'username': username})
    
    return profile_details

# This function would be used once specific candidate usernames are identified
# Example usage:
# candidate_profile = get_candidate_profile('johndoe')
```
