#### Weighted Scoring Approach

Different roles may require different emphasis on evaluation dimensions. The following provides sample weightings by role type:

**Software Engineer**
- Technical Competence: 40%
- Professional Experience: 25%
- Cultural Alignment: 15%
- Growth Potential: 10%
- Role-Specific Competencies: 10%

**Data Scientist**
- Technical Competence: 35%
- Professional Experience: 20%
- Cultural Alignment: 15%
- Growth Potential: 10%
- Role-Specific Competencies: 20%

**Product Manager**

#### Calculation Method

1. **Individual Dimension Score**
   - Calculate average rating across all questions in a dimension
   - Example: Technical Competence = (Q1 + Q2 + Q3 + Q4) / 4

2. **Weighted Overall Score**
   - Multiply each dimension score by its weight percentage
   - Sum all weighted dimension scores
   - Example: Overall Score = (Tech × 0.4) + (Exp × 0.25) + (Culture × 0.15) + (Growth × 0.1) + (Role × 0.1)

3. **Minimum Thresholds**
   - Establish minimum acceptable scores for critical dimensions
   - Example: Technical Competence must be at least 3.0 for engineering roles

4. **Comparative Ranking**
   - Rank candidates based on overall weighted scores
   - Consider dimension-specific strengths for tie-breaking
   - Flag exceptional performance in critical areas
