## System Overview

The Autonomous Recruitment System is a microservices-based architecture that automates the entire recruitment process. The system consists of five core modules:

1. **Candidate Sourcing AI**: Automatically discovers and engages potential candidates across multiple platforms.
2. **Resume Screening AI**: Analyzes resumes and extracts structured information to evaluate candidates.
3. **Interview Scheduling System**: Coordinates and automates the interview process.
4. **Candidate Evaluation Framework**: Assesses candidates through intelligent question generation and response analysis.
5. **Hiring Workflow Manager**: Orchestrates the end-to-end process from decision support through offer management and onboarding.

Each module operates independently but integrates seamlessly through well-defined APIs to create a cohesive recruitment pipeline.

## Configuration

### System-Wide Configuration

The main configuration file is located at `config/system_config.yaml`. This file contains global settings that affect the entire system:

```yaml
system:
  environment: production  # Options: development, testing, production
  log_level: info  # Options: debug, info, warning, error, critical
  max_concurrent_processes: 10
  default_timeout_seconds: 30

    min_length: 12
    require_uppercase: true
    require_lowercase: true
    require_numbers: true
    require_special_chars: true
  session_timeout_minutes: 30
  jwt_expiry_hours: 24

notifications:
  email:
    enabled: true
    send_daily_digest: true
  sms:
    enabled: true
    critical_alerts_only: false

storage:
  resume_storage_path: /data/resumes
  document_storage_path: /data/documents
  temp_storage_path: /data/temp
  max_file_size_mb: 10
```

### Module-Specific Configuration

Each module has its own configuration file in the `config/modules/` directory:

- `sourcing_config.yaml`: Settings for candidate sourcing
- `screening_config.yaml`: Settings for resume screening
- `scheduling_config.yaml`: Settings for interview scheduling
- `evaluation_config.yaml`: Settings for candidate evaluation
- `workflow_config.yaml`: Settings for hiring workflow

Example of `sourcing_config.yaml`:

```yaml
sourcing:
  platforms:
    linkedin:
      enabled: true
      search_limit_per_day: 100
      connection_request_limit_per_day: 50
      message_limit_per_day: 30
      search_delay_seconds: 5
    github:
      enabled: true
      search_limit_per_hour: 30
      profile_view_limit_per_day: 100
    stackoverflow:
      enabled: true
      search_limit_per_day: 50

    skill_weight: 0.4
    experience_weight: 0.3
    education_weight: 0.2
    location_weight: 0.1
```

## Module Integration

### Integration Architecture

The modules communicate through a combination of:

1. **REST APIs**: Synchronous communication between modules
2. **Message Queues**: Asynchronous task processing
3. **Shared Database**: For persistent storage of recruitment data

![Integration Architecture Diagram](docs/images/integration_architecture.png)

### API Gateway

All external communication goes through the API Gateway, which handles:

- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting
- Request routing
- Response caching
- API versioning

### Service Discovery

Services register themselves with the service registry on startup, allowing for dynamic discovery and load balancing.

### Event-Driven Communication

The system uses an event-driven architecture for asynchronous processes:

1. **Events**: Standardized messages that represent state changes
2. **Publishers**: Services that emit events
3. **Subscribers**: Services that consume and react to events
4. **Event Store**: Persistent storage of all events for auditing and replay

## API Documentation

### Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

To obtain a token:

```
POST /api/auth/token
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "username": "your_username",
  "password": "your_password"
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 86400
}
```

Use this token in subsequent requests:

```
GET /api/candidates
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```
